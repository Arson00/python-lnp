Modifying the source code
=========================
PyLNP is licensed under the ISC license (see ``COPYING.txt``), which essentially
allows you to modify and distribute changes as you see fit. (This only
applies to the launcher. Any bundled utilities, graphics packs, etc. have
their own licenses; refer to those projects separately.)
